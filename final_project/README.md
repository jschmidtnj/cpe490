# final project

- creating a final product or demo at the end
  - preferably something new
  - need a good story
  - need lots of charts and figures, data, etc
- problem - domestic usage or disaster relief or poverty?
  - decided to do disaster relief
- solution
  - mesh network for disaster relief
  - maybe repeat good signals for a longer distance to others
    - phone hotspot repeat
  - create gui for contacting help and specifying location, message
    - admin panel for aggregating data
  - simple p2p communication
  - facilitate normal people helping in disaster relief
  - satellite networks to tap into for when cell towers are down

## abstract

As the Earth gets warmer due to climate change, there are more and more natural disaster scenarios. Firefighters, the red cross, and emergency workers are overburdened with these extreme weather events, especially if vital communication networks are damaged. In the event of a network outage, rescue workers are unable to leverage the power of the internet, and are forced to use less efficient ways of organization and communication. Therefore, our project tackles these problems by establishing a low power communications network using a “mesh” of multiple wireless access points. These low-power devices broadcast a connected network over a disaster area, hosting a web-based communications platform providing limited messaging and organizational capabilities to people stranded within the disaster area. With ESP32 SoC microcontrollers at the heart of the network, this solution enables a 433Mhz network broadcast that can span 2.6 km per access point. The final outcome from this project will be a medium-bandwidth, battery-powered mesh-network; a disaster-relief web application; and a detailed analysis of overall performance.
